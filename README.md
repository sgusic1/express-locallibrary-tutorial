# express-locallibrary-tutorial
This is an Express web application that implements a basic library menagement system.

## Features
You can browse and manage:

- Lists of all Books, Authors, Book instances and Genres.
- Detailed pages for each item.
- CRUD funcitonality for all entity types.

## Technology stack
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose ODM)
- **Templating:** Pug

## Getting started
### 1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### 2) Create a '.env' file
In the project root, create a file named `.env` and set your own MongoDB connection string:
```env
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
```
Example MONGODB_URI string for a local database:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/library
```
### 3) Run the application
```bash
npm start
```
With debug output run:
```bash
npm run serverstart
```
#### then open http://localhost:3000

## üê≥ Docker Compose Setup
This repository contains a Docker Compose setup for running the **Express Local Library** app together with a MongoDB database.
It also includes a **populate** service for seeding the database with sample data.


## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker Compose v2+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Optional: `.env` file for custom database connection

## How It Works
### Services
- **`app`** ‚Äì Builds from the included Dockerfile (or uses the prebuilt image `sgusic29/express-locallibrary:latest`) and serves the library‚Äôs web interface and API.
  - Builds from `Dockerfile` if the image does not exist locally.
  - Reads database connection from `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.
  - Falls back to the internal `mongo` service if `MONGODB_URI` is not provided.
- **`mongo`** ‚Äì MongoDB 6.0 database
  - Stores data in a persistent named volume (`mongo-data`).
  - Includes a healthcheck so `app` waits until MongoDB is ready.
- **`populate`** ‚Äì One-off container to run `node populatedb.js` and seed the database.
  - Waits until `mongo` is healthy before running.
  - Does **not** run automatically on `docker compose up` (it‚Äôs opt-in).
