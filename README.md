# express-locallibrary-tutorial
This is an Express web application that implements a basic library menagement system.

## Features
You can browse and manage:

- Lists of all Books, Authors, Book instances and Genres.
- Detailed pages for each item.
- CRUD funcitonality for all entity types.

## Tech stack
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose ODM)
- **Templating:** Pug

## Getting started
### 1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### 2) Create a '.env' file
In the project root, create a file named `.env` and set your own MongoDB connection string:
```env
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
```
Example MONGODB_URI string for a local database:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/library
```
### 3) Run the application
```bash
npm start
```
With debug output run:
```bash
npm run serverstart
```
#### then open http://localhost:3000

## üê≥ Docker Compose Setup
This repository contains a Docker Compose setup for running the **Express Local Library** app together with a MongoDB database.
It also includes a **populate** service for seeding the database with sample data.


## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker Compose v2+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Optional: `.env` file for custom database connection

## How It Works
### Services
- **`app`** ‚Äì Builds from the included Dockerfile (or uses the prebuilt image `sgusic29/express-locallibrary:latest`) and serves the library‚Äôs web interface and API.
  - Builds from `Dockerfile` if the image does not exist locally.
  - Reads database connection from `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.
  - Falls back to the internal `mongo` service if `MONGODB_URI` is not provided.
- **`mongo`** ‚Äì MongoDB 6.0 database
  - Stores data in a persistent named volume (`mongo-data`).
  - Includes a healthcheck so `app` waits until MongoDB is ready.
- **`populate`** ‚Äì One-off container to run `node populatedb.js` and seed the database.
  - Waits until `mongo` is healthy before running.
  - Does **not** run automatically on `docker compose up` (it‚Äôs opt-in).


## Environment Variables
The app reads `MONGODB_URI` from a `.env` file in the project root to know which MongoDB instance to use.
### Example: connect to an external MongoDB instance
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://user:pass@mongo-host:27017/library?authSource=admin
```
If MONGODB_URI is not set, the app uses the built-in mongo service at:
```bash
mongodb://mongo:27017/library
```
## Usage
### Start App + MongoDB
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
### Start App + MongoDB
```bash
docker compose down
```
### Database Persistence
MongoDB stores its data in the named volume mongo-data, so data survives container restarts and up/down cycles:
```bash
volumes:
  - mongo-data:/data/db
```
to remove the data:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```
## Populate Database Service
The populate service runs populatedb.js to insert sample data.
It‚Äôs meant to be run manually, not automatically, so you only seed when you want to.

```bash
# Make sure mongo is running
docker compose up -d mongo

# Run populate once (container removed after it exits)
docker compose run --rm populate
```
